				<h3><img src = "bullet_right.png" alt= "bullet" id = "bullet"  height ="20" width = "20"/> Can I customize my cake order?</h3>
				<p>Yes, cakes and cupcakes can be decorated with edible images, inscriptions 

					and themed sugar decons. The image is edible ink printed on top of rice paper that 

					adheres to the icing and inscriptions are in butter cream. To place a custom order, call your local bakery  </p>
